# Recipe-Finder-App

A simple web application for finding recipes using TheMealDB API. Users can search for recipes by name, and the app displays the recipe's name, image, category, and instructions. This project is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes the endpoint https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s= to fetch recipe data.
